## End-to-End Retail Sales Data Analysis
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using a real-world retail sales dataset from Kaggle. The raw data was extracted using the Kaggle API, cleaned and standardized in Python, and loaded into a MySQL database for analysis. The dataset was transformed by handling missing values, correcting inconsistent fields, converting data types, and creating key business metrics such as sale price, discount amount, and profit. SQL queries were then used to generate insights into sales performance, revenue trends, profitability, and regional performance. Overall, this project highlights the process of moving from raw data to actionable business insights using Python and SQL.

## Key Features
- Extracted the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. 
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Python and Pandas.
- Standardized column names, corrected data types, and handled missing or inconsistent values.
- Created key metrics including sale price, discount amount, and profit.
- Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy.
- Performed SQL analysis to identify:
  - Top-performing products and profitable sub-categories.
  - Regional sales leaders and state-wise performance.
  - Month-over-month growth and year-to-year trends.
- Demonstrated end-to-end ETL workflow from raw data to business insights.
